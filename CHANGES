1.0

A jump 0.3 -> 1.0 is made because the utility is now called "secstore",
and is largely incompatible with the gpm utility. Please refer to the
README for a migration guide.

- GPM_<COMMAND> variables are no longer handled
- list now uses a builtin function; removed GPM_LSCMD
- All other GPM_* variables have been renamed to SECSTORE_*
- Newlines are now handled intelligently, rather than manually:
  + The add subcommand appends a newline at the end of its input, if
    there isn't one already.
  + The copy subcommand removes the last newline character.
- add, move and remove subcommands now have an -f (force) flag
- The move subcommand now behaves more like Unix mv(1)
- Shortest unique prefixes of subcommands are no longer accepted, but
  some aliases are.

0.3

- Added the copy subcommand
- Added the {add|copy|show} -Nn flags
- Added the GPM_<COMMAND> environment variables
- Shell metacharacters are now correctly escaped!

0.2

- Completely rewrote in perl
- Added support for creating directories of arbitrary depth within GPM_DIR
- Added support for GPM_GPG environment variable and -g flag
- The GPM_RECIPIENT environment variable and -r flag are now optional
- Added support for multiline secrets
- Added the -m flag for the add command
- The add command no longer forces the .gpg suffix
- Added support for the GPM_LSCMD environment variable
- The rm command now asks before each removal (for forced removal use
  "cd $GPM_DIR && rm -f $file")
- No longer trying to be "clever" about newlines
- The pm2gpm script is now a bit more secure
- Some man page fixes
