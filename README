secstore is a secret storage manager, similar to pass, but more
flexible, and written in perl. In particular, you are allowed to choose
which commands to use for encryption/decryption/copying, and a more
arbitrary file hierarchy is permitted.

secstore is a continuation of gpm.

The dependencies are:

- Digest::SHA
- gpg (optional)
- xclip (optional)


gpm to secstore migration

$ mv ~/.gpm ~/.secstore
$ find ~/.secstore -type f -exec chmod u+w {} +

Instead of ~/.{gpm,secstore} you might use $XDG_DATA_HOME/{gpm,secstore}
or $GPM_DIR and $SECSTORE_DIR.
