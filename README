gpm is a gpg-based password manager, similar to pass, but much simpler, and
free of the bash dependency. gpm is developed from my other now-deprecated
openssl-based password manager pm. To convert pm passwords into gpm passwords,
please use the pm2gpm script. For installation run `make install'.

The dependencies are:

- Digest::SHA
- gpg
- xclip (optional)
